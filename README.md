# A-path-finding-with-obstruction

The logic is fairly simple. Keep finding the node with smallest F value, where F = G(edge or distance from the start node)+ h(distance from that node to the end node)

you can also create obstruction which is the black line 

also, you can erase the points selected using right click

The shortest path is displayed with the help of green nodes from start node to end node
